1. Create an empty stack S.
2. Initialize current node as root.
3. Push the current node to S and set current = current->left until current is NULL.
4. If current is NULL and stack is not empty then:
	a) Pop the top item from stack;
	b) Print the popped item, set current = popped_item->right;
	c) Go to step 3;
5.If current is NULL and stack is empty then we are done.
